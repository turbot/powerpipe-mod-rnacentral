## Installation

Download and install Powerpipe (https://powerpipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/powerpipe
```

## Clone the Mod Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe-mod-rnacentral.git
cd powerpipe-mod-rnacentral
```

## Get the Dataset

RNAcentral provides a public Postgres database that can be used to query the data using SQL syntax. We will use the `rnacentral` database to query the data.

## Usage

Run the dashboard and specify the DB connection string:

```sh
powerpipe server --database postgres://reader:NWDMCE5xdipIjRrp@hh-pgsql-public.ebi.ac.uk:5432/pfmegrnargs
```
